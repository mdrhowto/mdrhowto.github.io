Audyssey was preparing to launch a new product app for the iPhone store. They hired Media Done Right to build a microsite that worked as well on mobile as it did a desktop top in order to help demonstrate AMP: the Audyssey Media Player.

Media Done Right utilized many best practices building the site using a mobile first approach, web fonts, social network integration, media, and of course Drupal with custom SASS and javascript. The website is a responsive design that support at least eight layouts: Desktop, Large Tablet, phablet, and phone, in both vertical and landscape mode. In addition we utilized javascript to dynamically load headphone images from the very large image library from the AMP media server, which helped with the performance of the site.
