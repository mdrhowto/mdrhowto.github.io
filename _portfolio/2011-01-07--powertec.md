Powertec installs solar power solutions in Northern California.  They approached Media Done Right with a logo, green of course, and some ideas of what they wanted to accomplish with their website.  Media Done Right created a clean custom design that combined an Adobe Flash based photo-flow slide show with a Drupal back-end for content management which allows them to manage and grow their site.
