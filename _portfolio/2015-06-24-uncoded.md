From inception to launch, this website took less than a week! The initial idea that quickly transformed into Uncoded was the brainchild of Mike Stewart, owner of Media Done Right and long-time community organizer. With the help of other founding members, especially Aaron Pedersen of DevelopmentArc, the website was quickly built based upon the Open Source Jekyll Theme, also built by Media Done Right. It is currently hosted on Uncoded's GitHub account which allows for greater community participation.
