Warner Brothers Records (WBR) created one of the largest multi-site Drupal installations with over 200 artists.  Media Done Right was brought in as a subcontractor by another local company to help build the site for David Hodges. The site was launched and live in 2009-2010 before David Hodges and WBR apparently split.
