[Long Beach based startup, CritiqueIT](http://www.critiqueit.com), provides a cloud based solution for multi-modal—text, audio, video—annotation on docs, images, audio and video files.  Media Done Right was contracted to re-build their existing website using Wordpress in order to provide new responsive capabilities and an updated look.  One of CritiqueIt's product integrations is available as a wordpress plug-in.  So, they chose Wordpress for their main website in order to more easily demonstrate the capabilities of thier product.
