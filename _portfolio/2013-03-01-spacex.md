SpaceX contracted with Media Done Right to enhance their web team with the re-launch of their new website. Our team was brought in for our front-end expertise with responsive/mobile website development and JavaScript. We helped bring a marketing design to life using Drupal by building some of the key elements on the website.

The main components we built for them included site-wide elements such as the Primary Navigation, Footer, and floating sidebars. In addition we built the Featured News widget in addition to other front-end work.
