Lori Roudebush approached Media Done Right to help create a web presence for her startup company: <em>Get It Together</em>, which focuses on home organization in the bay-area of Northern California. Get It Together specializes in creating order in the lives of her clients. It was in that vein, GIT wanted a minimalist website that reflected her business services. She also didn't want her website to look like every other website. The result is a vintage 50's throwback website built using the latest in tech; Jekyll with a bootstrap theme.
