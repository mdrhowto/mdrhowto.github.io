## We Are a Web Development Shop

Anyone can bake a cake. Some can make it tasty. Anyone can make a website. Some can make it right. We can. We make websites. If you have a website made by your cousins nephew and now you're ready for website 2.0, or just want your business or idea on the interwebs... contact us.

Really, you're still reading this stuff? Let's see, here's the low-down: We develop websites. More specifically, we design websites. We theme, build, customize, and deploy websites based on Drupal. Plus we can maintain and optimize your Drupal website. We only use Drupal, which means we know Drupal really well when develop a website.

Plus we use open source software for everything we do. We donate time, energy, and money to community projects we believe in. Drupal, Ubuntu, and Inkscape are some of our fav's but we also help organize LA Drupal, and DrupalCamp LA. We're involved mostly just because we're geeks, its fun, and its how we learn geek stuff. But we think you should too. Everyone benefits. You gain software built from the community. In most cases, Open Source software has more features, is more secure, and gets you most (or all) of the features you need, and the cost of the software is free. Plus if you choose a firm, like Media Done Right, that specializes in Open Source Software, your development costs are minimized since we're not wasting time learning and already have a solid network for support. You end up with a world-class solution, at prices that are below market value for proprietary solutions.

But if you're not too into open source software, and all this is starting to sound "too sales-y" we promise that hiring us is actually enough to rid you of your guilt. Plus, we have better morals and values than our slimy and cheating competitors. Ok, we're not always funny, but we're fun - and geeky. :-P

So maybe if we mixed in some amazing tales about saving humanity through web development... and blah, blah, blah. You get the idea. Marketing.

Ok, really, all you need to know is we're good at creating and building websites. We do this because we love it, and we think you'll love your website as a result. Just hire us and you'll be happy. (we will too).
