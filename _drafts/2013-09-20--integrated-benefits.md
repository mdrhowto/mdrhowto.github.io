Integrated Benefit Consultants was one of the first Drupal projects taken on by Media Done Right. The website launched as iBenefitConsult.com, was originally built on Drupal 4.6 and later upgraded (through 4.7.x and 5.x, 6) and finally Drupal 7.  The latest theme was a custom design by Juxtaflo, Inc and eventually made responsive by Media Done Right in 2013.
