Media Done Right was brought in by Magnitude Inc to build a website for Discovery Preschool's new branding initiative.  MDR was provided with design comps and website goals.  We built a site based on Drupal 6, and created our first fusion themed site.  One of the cool things about the site is that it automatically takes images from the gallery and randomly rotates them in order to maintain the basic effect of the original design.  In addition, each page randomly loads images.  Fun!  So ya, it has a photo gallery for the parents, and makes extensive use of css3 standards.
